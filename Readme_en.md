DOSBoxLauncher configures and starts DOS applications (e.g. games) using an existing / installed DOSBox app on the system. 
DOSBox itself is not part of this app and must be installed separately (see https://www.dosbox.com). 
A simple configuration with a few parameters is in the foreground. DOSBoxLauncher is therefore less suitable for cataloging 
and managing complex collections of DOS applications.
