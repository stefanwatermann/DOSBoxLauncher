# DOSBox Launcher

![AppLogo](/Images/AppIcon_128.png)

DOSBox Launcher is an easy to use DOSBox frontend (GUI) to configure and start DOS applications (e.g. games) using the DOSBox app on your computer. 
DOSBox itself is not part of this app and must be installed separately (see [www.dosbox.com](https://www.dosbox.com)). 

Having a simple configuration with few parameters is in the focus. DOSBox Launcher is therefore less suitable for cataloging 
and managing complex collections of DOS applications.

DOSBox Launchers interface supports English and German language and currently runs on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

Download of compiled app, current version 1.2.2:

*See <a href="https://github.com/stefanwatermann/DOSBoxLauncher/wiki">wiki pages</a> for more details.*

The main window shows a list of the configured DOS applications / games. A double click starts the respective game.

The configuration of the DOSBox options takes place either in "simple" or "expert" mode.
The "simple" mode allows the quick configuration of essential DOSBox options by means of a simple dialog.

In "Expert" mode, the DOSBox configuration file for the application can be edited directly. All DOSBox options and configuration variants can be used here. Full control over the DOS application is available.
