# DOSBoxLauncher

![AppLogo](/Images/AppIcon_128.png)

DOSBoxLauncher configures and starts DOS applications (e.g. games) using the DOSBox app on the system. 
DOSBox itself is not part of this app and must be installed separately (see https://www.dosbox.com). 

Having a simple configuration with few parameters is in the focus. DOSBoxLauncher is therefore less suitable for cataloging 
and managing complex collections of DOS applications.

DOSBoxLaunchers interface supports English and German language and currently runs on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

The configuration of the DOSBox options takes place either in "simple" or in "expert" mode.
The "simple" mode allows the quick configuration of essential DOSBox options by means of a simple dialog.

In "Expert" mode, the DOSBox configuration file for the application can be edited directly. All DOSBox options and configuration variants can be used here. Full control over the DOS application is available.
